# Introduction
QML has emerged across various paradigms, each pushing the boundaries of conventional machine learning. The journey began with the inception of quantum ML in 2014 when a quantum version of support vector machines (QSVM) was introduced. QSVM exhibited logarithmic speedup compared to classical counterparts, marking the first paradigm shift. The second paradigm, Quantum-inspired ML, gained momentum in 2019 with the proposal of a binary quantum classifier, drawing inspiration from quantum theory formalism. This novel classifier indicated superior performance compared to classical models. Similarly, a hybrid quantum-classical classifier leveraging variational quantum circuits was introduced, paving the way for hybrid quantum-classical ML. Moreover, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have seen remarkable advancements, including Quantum-Inspired NNs, Quantum Multi-Perceptron NNs, Quantum Dot NNs, and Quantum Convolutional NNs.
